         Integration with other Frameworks
         -----------

Integration with other web Frameworks

  Tiles can be integrated with other web frameworks. Usually this kind of
  integration is made through extensions/plugins to Tiles.

  * {{{http://struts.apache.org/1.x/index.html}Struts 1}}: Currently under
  development. A Struts 1 plugin is available in the SVN trunk, that presumably
  will be released along with Struts 1.4.

  * {{{http://struts.apache.org/development/2.x/struts2-plugins/struts2-tiles-plugin/apidocs/index.html}Struts 2}}: at the time of this
  writing, the Struts 2 Tiles plugin still uses Tiles version 2.

  * {{{http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/view.html#view-tiles}Spring MVC}}:
  Spring-3.2 can integration up to Tiles-2 and Tiles-3.



  For a closer look at custom integrations the
  {{{https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/tree/v3.2.0.RELEASE/spring-webmvc-tiles3/src/main/java/org/springframework/web/servlet/view/tiles3}spring code}}:
  forms a good example.
