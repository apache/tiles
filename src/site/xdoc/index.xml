        <section name="Tiles 2">

                <p><strong>Tiles 2</strong> is an effort to extract the Tiles library
                from Struts. It is currently housed in the Sandbox area
                of the Apache Struts Subversion repository.</p>

                <p>Much of the <a
                href="http://struts.apache.org/struts-action/struts-tiles">
                Struts Tiles</a> documentation will also be useful in
                understanding how to use Tiles 2.</p>

            <a name="downloads"/>
            <subsection name="Downloads">

                <p>As a sandbox project, Tiles 2 has no formal
                releases.  However, snapshots are occasionally published to
                Apache's Maven 2 snapshot repository, which can be accessed with
                the following configuration:</p>

                <source><![CDATA[
                  <repository>
                      <id>apache.snapshots</id>
                      <name>Apache Maven Snapshot Repository</name>
                      <url>http://people.apache.org/repo/m2-snapshot-repository</url>
                  </repository>
                ]]>
                </source>

                <p>After configuring the repository, declare a dependency on
                Tiles 2:</p>

                <source><![CDATA[
                  <dependency>
                      <groupId>org.apache.tiles</groupId>
                      <artifactId>tiles-core</artifactId>
                      <version>2.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
                  </dependency>
                ]]>
                </source>

            <p>If you are not using Maven 2, you can find a recent development
            snapshot of tiles-core.jar <a
            href="http://people.apache.org/maven-snapshot-repository/org/apache/struts/tiles/tiles-core/">
            here</a>, or a nightly build, <a
            href="http://people.apache.org/builds/struts/nightlies/tiles/">here</a>.</p>

           <p>You can see Tiles 2 in action by downloading a snapshot of the 'tiles-test' webapp,
           <a href="http://people.apache.org/repo/m2-snapshot-repository/org/apache/struts/tiles/tiles-test/2.0-SNAPSHOT/">
           here</a>.</p>
